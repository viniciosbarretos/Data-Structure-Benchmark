# Data-Structure-Benchmark

The objective of this work is to compare the efficiency of search algorithms in different data structures.

For the accomplishment of the experiment was used 3 different types of structures:
1. Conventional Binary Tree
2. Balanced Binary Tree with AVL Method
3. Array sorted with QuickSort algorithm
